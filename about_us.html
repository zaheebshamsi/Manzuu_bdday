        <h2>
            It all began with a casual scroll through Instagram, where a single reel caught my attention.
            <br>Little did I know, that seemingly innocuous video would mark the beginning of a beautiful journey.
            <br>It was around five years ago, back in 2019, when our paths first crossed in the digital realm.
            <br>I vividly recall the moment when you said, "<em><u>I like me too</u></em>," and I hateeee you for it.
            <br>They resonated with me in a way I couldn't quite explain.
            <br>From that instant, our conversations flowed effortlessly, and before I knew it, I found myself ensnared in the captivating charm of your presence.
            <br>We talked and talked, each exchange drawing me in deeper until I realized I was helplessly "<u><em>Phas gaya tere jaal me</em></u>".
            <br>Despite the uncertainties and challenges along the way, I've never experienced such fulfillment and happiness until now.
            <br>You, <strong>Zaman Sarfaraz</strong>, have brought a sense of completeness into my life that I never knew was missing &#10084;
